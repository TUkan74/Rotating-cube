# 3D Cube Renderer
This program is a simple yet interactive 3D cube renderer written in Python using Pygame. It allows users to view a cube in 3D space and manipulate its orientation through keyboard and mouse inputs. Each side of the cube is rendered with a different color for better visualization.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the Pygame and NumPy libraries. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from python.org. To install Pygame and NumPy, run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```
## Usage
To start the program, navigate to the program's directory in your terminal and run:
```shell
python cube_renderer.py
```
Once the program is running, a window displaying a 3D cube will appear. You can interact with the cube using the keyboard and mouse.

## Features
- 3D Cube Visualization: View a color-coded cube in a 3D perspective.
- Interactive Rotation: Rotate the cube along its X, Y, and Z axes using mouse movements or keyboard inputs.
- Adjustable Viewpoint: Zoom in and out to get a closer or broader view of the cube.

## Controls
- Rotate the Cube:
  - Mouse: Click and drag to rotate the cube.
  - Keyboard: Use W, A, S, D for rotation along X and Y axes, and Q, E for rotation along the Z axis.
- Zoom In/Out: Use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to zoom in and out.
- Adjust Rotation Speed: Increase with Z, decrease with X.
- Reset Cube Orientation: Press R to reset the cube to its original orientation and position.
- Quit: Press ESC to exit the program.
